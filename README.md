# MyUnderPlayerSiteNewVersion
This project contains the static website for **UnderPlayer** along with a small
PHP script for saving user reviews. The site is written mostly in HTML and
JavaScript with playful visual effects.

New features include a theme switcher and a convenient scroll to top button.
The review submission script now relies on environment variables for database
credentials to avoid storing them directly in the code.
